* Open a python3 shell and write this *

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
cryptokey = Fernet.generate_key().decode('UTF-8')
cryptokey


* copy the cryptokey and open a bash shell *
* in the bash shell past the contents of cryptokey *
* to an environmental variable *

export CRYPTOKEY="--contents of python cryptokey--"


* to access the key use the os.environ command from *
* python, and make sure to encode the key to bytes *
